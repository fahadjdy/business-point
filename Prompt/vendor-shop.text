1️⃣ Core Architecture Rule (Very Important)
Routing & Layer Separation

Super Admin

All Super Admin routes must be defined in:

routes/web.php


Super Admin features are web-only

No Super Admin functionality should rely on API routes

User / Vendor (Shop, Doctor, Barber)

All User and Vendor functionality must use:

routes/api.php


Reason:

Same APIs are consumed by:

Web layer

Android application

No vendor or user logic should be implemented in web.php

2️⃣ Common Module Guidelines

Maintain identical structure and behavior for:

vendor/shop/admin/*

vendor/doctor/admin/*

vendor/barber/admin/*

Follow consistent:

Route naming

Controller structure

Permissions

UI/UX flow

APIs must be:

Stateless

Authenticated

Role-aware

Version-ready (future-proof)

3️⃣ API Structure (User & Vendor Only)
Base API Namespace
/api/vendor/shop/admin/*
/api/vendor/doctor/admin/*
/api/vendor/barber/admin/*

API Rules

All APIs must:

Reside in routes/api.php

Be reusable across Web & Android

Follow RESTful conventions

Return standardized JSON responses

Authentication via API guard

Authorization based on user–vendor ownership

4️⃣ Super Admin Panel (Web Only)
Routing

All Super Admin routes:

routes/web.php

Super Admin auth middleware

✅ Final Architectural Summary
Layer	Route File	Purpose
Super Admin	web.php	Web-only admin operations
User / Vendor	api.php	Shared Web + Android logic
Android App	API	Consumes same vendor/user APIs
Web Frontend	API	Uses same APIs as mobile
